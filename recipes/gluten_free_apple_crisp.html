            <li>▢ 1/2 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour with xanthan gum, I like Pillsbury gluten-free flour</li>
            <li>▢ 1/2 cup gluten-free quick oats</li>

            <li>▢ 1/3 cup butter, diced into small cubes and softened, Dairy-free/vegan use Smart Balance butter.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Filling</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>▢ 4 cups apples, peeled and chopped </li>
            <li>▢ 3 tablespoons melted butter, Dairy-free/vegan use Smart Balance butter</li>
            <li>▢ 2 tablespoons gluten-free all-purpose flour with xanthan gum</li>
            <li>▢ 1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>▢ 3 tablespoons milk, Dairy-free/vegan use unsweetened almond milk.</li>
            <li>▢ 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>▢ 1/4 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>▢ 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>▢ 1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F and spray an 8" x 8" baking dish with gluten-free nonstick cooking spray. I like
                gluten-free coconut oil spray. </li>
            <li>To make the topping: In a medium-size bowl, combine the crumb topping ingredients and mix with a fork
                until it resembles chunky crumbs. Refrigerate while you prepare the apple filling.</li>
            <li>Add the peeled and chopped apples to a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, milk, melted butter, pure
                vanilla extract, packed brown sugar, ground cinnamon, gluten-free flour, and salt and stir until fully
                combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the apple mixture into a greased baking dish and spread in to an even layer. Sprinkle crumb topping
                evenly over the apples. Bake for 30–35 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool for
                5-10 minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Store in an air-tight container and refrigerate leftovers for up to 3 days. The apple crisp can be
                frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and reheat in a microwave or a 350°F oven
                for 20 minutes. </li>
        </ol>
